learn a bit about the different between "var" + "cont" + "let" 
var is a "function-scoped" meaning that a variable declared with a var exists within the finction in wich it wi declared, or outside the function it is will declared when it scoped.
let and const more like similar as know for "blcok-scope", but the const is a bit different

I do today aslo lrean about the string value. Something is very basic from a youtube video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww&ab_channel=SuperSimpleDev"
